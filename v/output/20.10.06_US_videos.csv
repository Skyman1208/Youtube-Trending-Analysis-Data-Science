While we‚Äôre waiting for the new PS5 reveal event date following its postponement, let‚Äôs take a look at all the PlayStation 5 price rumors and how things are shaping up in the price war between the PS5 and the Xbox Series X.All rumors are pointing to the PS5 being significantly more expensive than the PS4. Just taking inflation into account, we‚Äôre looking at a $450 minimum price for the PS5. Add all the advanced tech to the mix and the console will most likely be around $500 dollars, which lines up with what most of the tech experts expect. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be intent on undercutting the price of the PS5. Reports indicate that they‚Äôre waiting for Sony to announce the price first so they could swoop in and steal their thunder with an even cheaper price for their Xbox Series X. Backwards compatibility is a huge selling point for the Series X as it‚Äôll be compatible with each generation of Xbox, but don‚Äôt believe the recent PS5 leak that it‚Äôll be compatible with PS4, PS3 and PS2 games. It‚Äôs probably just the top 100 PS4 games.There‚Äôs more to the price war between the PS5 and Xbox Series X than just that so enjoy the video, let us know which console you think is going to be cheaper at launch in the comments section below and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to TheGamer for more gaming content.For copyright matters, please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/thegamerwebsitehttps://www.facebook.com/thegamercom/ Our Websitehttp://thegamer.com"

It's true, this jet boat has no brakes, no seat belts, no transmission and yet we still treat it like a fast drag car when we spool up the turbos and unleash the twin-turbo Hemi on the water. How is this possible? Well, we'll show you. In this video we explain how we redirect the water coming out of the jet drive to the sides of the boat, which enables us to rev the engine to over 4,000 rpm and then drop the hammer and take off like we've been shot out of cannon! and just for fun, we lined up 100 ft behind my neighbors PWC for a short drag race on our local lake! No surprise, we blew past the PWC like it was tied to a dock. It was still fun though. Want more info about the jet drive parts we are using? Give B1 Racing a shout at (949) 294-1394 or Henry Morris at 302-530-1522. want a Game Over shirt? visit my website at: https://www.fsmgarage.comThanks for watching. -Finnegan"

We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries before 2020 and all 7 continents, we have no plans to slow down anytime soon, and we are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)"

Today I am going to be painting on and customizing a set of Russian nesting dolls (or matryoshka dolls). I have been waiting (and some of you too) forever to paint these, so I was really excited to finally decorate these and add my own style to them. It's a different type of doll customization haha. This was a really fun art project to do, I highly recommend it if you are looking for creative activities to do. There is so much potential to do all kinds of different characters with these and create a completely original set. These are really awesome collectibles and make for such cool home decor. I could definitely see myself building a collection of them. They're also really fun to take apart and put back together lolI hope you guys enjoy watching me customize these dolls.

Sign petitions. Donate if you‚Äôre able. For the next month (June), the revenue this video generates will be donated to Black Lives Matter Charities. - This link is a great place to start -- https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/- This is an article about how to support Black Organizations and Anti-Racist groups if you are in Canada (like me) -- https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/black-organizations-anti-racist-groups-canada_ca_5ed57ea1c5b6867b30853e20_____Two collabs, one right after the other. Self-isolation isn‚Äôt fun but it‚Äôs turned me into a MACHINE. A healthy work-life balance? What‚Äôs that? Never heard of her. Anyway, I approached Cami about this collab a few months ago (i think? Who knows, everything is a blur) and she very kindly agreed!  She even went ahead and made a video to go along with the cover! What‚Äôs it like to have that many talents, I must know. She kicked butt. She always kicks butt. A super big thanks to Miyo for kicking butt with this instrumental as well! As always, thank you all for your continued love and support!

So, Jack comes to his rescue and they have a dunk contest IN THE DARK.Later, the team has practice and learns that they're gonna have to play the next tournament without Coleman, who has a shoulder injury. Coleman's one of the stars of the team, so SOMEONE is gonna need to step up if Prolific's gonna win!Before the tournament, Mike's dad comes into town. Did y'all know he's a MONGOLIAN LEGEND and was a Harlem Globetrotter? CRAZY. Don't sleep, Mike is a star in Mongolia too! As Jordan says, he's got a lot of clout.Finally, it's time for the game. Can Prolific win without its star forward? If Jalen Green has anything to say about it, then YES.

I will start positive first and end with the negativity that I am addressing at this time. Friday morning, 6/5, Mary and I spoke to one another privately. She said in her most recent update video, that I had permission to share the conversation. I will not be doing this, but rather of giving an outlook on the situation and what has occurred since it began. Although us speaking to one another doesn't fix things on either ends, it does give me clarity that I now understand where she was coming from and feeling. Our conversation started off with frustration and anger on both parts, but ended with a bit of understanding and I am grateful for that. I did NOT expect this apology video to go trending, at first I couldn't understand why SO many people.. thousands.. were coming here to comment certain narratives that had nothing to do with the situation at hand. It all happened so fast, in the beginning, that for the first time in six years of this channel, I had to turn off the comments. Because of the words being said, some wishing me, BEGGING me to commit su!c!de, claiming they were going to have my kids removed, telling me to watch my back every moment of everyday until I quit, and so much more, much worse that I won't be posting here.. it was quite a lot at once. I had to remove myself from my husband and kids and get help immediately. I had to turn off comments for my safety and sanity. That did not stop people from going to my other social media, and the next morning when I planned on coming home, I hopped on Twitter to find Mary had created one. Her DMs were turned off, probably because of the new account, but I retweeted one of her tweets and she saw it, Dmd me, and we spoke. I stand by my apology to Mary and Mary only. Out of the 6,000 people I lost on our channel, what I have asked of the FAMILY members that left.. I ask if they ever wanted to come back, to check back up in six to twelve months to see if I have changed. If so, they can can choose at that time whether or not they would like to return. With that being said, here is my update, thank you, and statement regarding this for now.First off, to every ASMR creator who reached out to me.. making sure I was ok.. I can't even begin to thank you. People found my phone number from years ago. It would probably take days, if not weeks.. to go through the amount of love, suggestion, constructive criticism, help, and more that I have recieved. Even the family members who have left this channel, some have left very helpful future comments for me to reflect on, and learn from. The rest of this week I said Id be reflecting. I will continue to do so. I am back home with my family, I am filming videos for the future, and I am moving on since talking to Mary. After getting myself together to watch from the outside what was going on, one that Mary nor I could control.. I wanted to say this.Those of you who have begged me to end my life, to quit my channel, to have my kids removed.. I will do none of it and I will have none of it. As I said in my apology video - I am not a bad person. I have made mistakes and all I can do is learn from them. I can educate, involve myself, and do better. This channel is a safe space and I will be DAMNED if ANYONE comes over here making it a war zone. I did not think of that when I called out Mary. I stand by my initial reasoning to do so, but the words I used toward her and her alone I do NOT stand by. I, again, am sorry to Mary and what she went through that 24 hours. Those of you who said what you said to ME, trying to make me pay, and knock me down a peg or two, never going to happen. Ive worked too hard for six years to change my life and work on myself, work that will never be done and will come with mistakes and consequence at times, I will never end that. This channel will always remain a safe space and in time I will turn back on the comments and we can continue to use this as a place for EVERYONE, and we will move on from this. You will NEVER run me off the internet. You will never be a reason of why I suffer in life. This is what I love, what I do, what I will always do until YouTube itself shuts down. I will never leave.With that being said, everyone who's asked and has been messaging, tweeting, calling, texting, blowing me up and caring, I am alright, and I am so grateful for you. I am so grateful for my YouTube family, even those who chose to have left because they were disappointed. You were not a troll but one who was concerned, hurt, and I wish you well whether you choose to return or not. I am currently home safe with my family, yesterday our town came together for the very first time to protest for the black lives matter movement, and it was beautiful. Things are changing, I am changing. I will be back soon./end"
