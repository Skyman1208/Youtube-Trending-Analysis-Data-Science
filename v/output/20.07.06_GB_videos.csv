Today I am going to be painting on and customizing a set of Russian nesting dolls (or matryoshka dolls). I have been waiting (and some of you too) forever to paint these, so I was really excited to finally decorate these and add my own style to them. It's a different type of doll customization haha. This was a really fun art project to do, I highly recommend it if you are looking for creative activities to do. There is so much potential to do all kinds of different characters with these and create a completely original set. These are really awesome collectibles and make for such cool home decor. I could definitely see myself building a collection of them. They're also really fun to take apart and put back together lolI hope you guys enjoy watching me customize these dolls.

Those protests have dominated news coverage. But when it comes to communicating the protests’ scale, character, and purpose, a lot of that coverage falls short.Part of that is because of the media’s incentive to highlight the most dramatic imagery; it’s why so much protest coverage has been filled with violent and chaotic scenes of fire, looters, and tear gas. But it’s also because of the nature of protest imagery itself. In this video, journalism professor Jason Johnson and Vox editor Kainaz Amaria explain that, while the news can show you what a protest looks like, it’s a lot worse at telling you why it’s happening.Further reading: https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/5/29/21274891/george-floyd-cop-arrested-minneapolis-breonna-taylorVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and two separate Starlink missions in May 2019 and in January 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Just Read the Instructions” droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. The Starlink satellites will deploy in an elliptical orbit approximately 15 minutes after liftoff. Prior to orbit raise, SpaceX engineers will conduct data reviews to ensure all Starlink satellites are operating as intended. Once the checkouts are complete, the satellites will then use their onboard ion thrusters to move into their intended orbits and operational altitude of 550 km."

If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them, Trump said. Riot police and military police used tear gas on protesters outside the White House.As the nation prepared for another night of violent protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd, President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military if states and cities failed to quell the demonstrations. “I am mobilizing all federal and local resources, civilian and military, to protect the rights of law abiding Americans,” Trump said during a hastily arranged address at the White House.“Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming presence until the violence is quelled,” Trump said.“If a city or state refuses to take the actions necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” said the president.Trump stopped short of invoking the Insurrection Act, an archaic law from 1807 that would allow Trump to deploy active-duty U.S. troops to respond to protests in cities across the country. “At this time, the president has not enacted the Insurrection Act,” a senior Defense Department official told CNBC. “I refer you to the White House for more.”During his address, Trump said he was taking “swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington DC,” adding, “What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace.”“As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property.” As the president spoke, riot police and military police outside the White House were using tear gas to clear protesters out of Lafayette Square, a public square in front of the president’s residence.Following his remarks, Trump left the White House and walked through the square, and it appeared strongly as though the riot police had forcibly cleared the square for the sole purpose of clearing a path for the president. Once he reached the far side of the square, Trump raised a bible in front of St. John’s Church, which had been set on fire by protesters the night before. The president did not try to talk to any of the protesters, however, leaving little doubt as to where his sympathies lay.

We will do the movements suuuuuper slow and controlled - to keep the tension as long as possible in the muscles & to build maximum strength. The burn is REAL.   No High Intensity, rather slooooow motion :) Those 15min will be fun - you got this! No excuses guys!__This method is called time under tension. We extend the eccentric phase of a movement (going down in a squat, lowering your body in a push up), hold for a second & go back to the starting position explosively. I will count you through the entire 15min haha:1, 2, 3, 4 - hold - AND UP ♥︎If you usually have troubles with feeling an exercise in the right place, you will probably have a better mind-muscle connection during this workout! __No Equipment needed. No Rests. Not much space needed. ▸ You can find free WORKOUT SCHEDULES on my Instagram Channel.
