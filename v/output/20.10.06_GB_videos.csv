This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video."

Late in the day on June 1, demonstrators gathered near the White House, on the edge of Lafayette Square, to protest police abuse following the death in custody of Minneapolis resident George Floyd. Similar protests had erupted across the country. Many were peaceful, but some included property destruction and clashes with police.At about 6:30 p.m., just north of the White House, federal police in riot gear fired gas canisters and used grenades containing rubber pellets to scatter the largely peaceful demonstrators. Their actions cleared the way for the president, surrounded by the nation‚Äôs top law enforcement and military leaders, to walk to the historic St. John‚Äôs Church for a three-minute photo op.

They made this decision to allow more voices to be heard, but does this mean they're also leaking information about their consoles price? SUBSCRIBE NOW to The Gamer! Click here: https://goo.gl/9cpWgf The price war may very well be the battle that wins Sony or Microsoft the entire console war. While we‚Äôre waiting for the new PS5 reveal event date following its postponement, let‚Äôs take a look at all the PlayStation 5 price rumors and how things are shaping up in the price war between the PS5 and the Xbox Series X.All rumors are pointing to the PS5 being significantly more expensive than the PS4. Just taking inflation into account, we‚Äôre looking at a $450 minimum price for the PS5. Add all the advanced tech to the mix and the console will most likely be around $500 dollars, which lines up with what most of the tech experts expect. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be intent on undercutting the price of the PS5. Reports indicate that they‚Äôre waiting for Sony to announce the price first so they could swoop in and steal their thunder with an even cheaper price for their Xbox Series X. Backwards compatibility is a huge selling point for the Series X as it‚Äôll be compatible with each generation of Xbox, but don‚Äôt believe the recent PS5 leak that it‚Äôll be compatible with PS4, PS3 and PS2 games. It‚Äôs probably just the top 100 PS4 games.There‚Äôs more to the price war between the PS5 and Xbox Series X than just that so enjoy the video, let us know which console you think is going to be cheaper at launch in the comments section below and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to TheGamer for more gaming content.For copyright matters, please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/thegamerwebsitehttps://www.facebook.com/thegamercom/ Our Websitehttp://thegamer.com"

This week I sang The Other Side from The Greatest Showman with the lovely Cami-Cat!Before we hop into the description of this video:I know the world has been scary as of late and I can only hope you‚Äôre all doing okay. I‚Äôve always looked at my channel as a way to take a step back and to take a break from whatever chaos may be going on in the world but I would like to take this moment to encourage you all to donate and support BLM charities and causes. Sign petitions. Donate if you‚Äôre able. For the next month (June), the revenue this video generates will be donated to Black Lives Matter Charities. - This link is a great place to start -- https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/- This is an article about how to support Black Organizations and Anti-Racist groups if you are in Canada (like me) -- https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/black-organizations-anti-racist-groups-canada_ca_5ed57ea1c5b6867b30853e20_____Two collabs, one right after the other. Self-isolation isn‚Äôt fun but it‚Äôs turned me into a MACHINE. A healthy work-life balance? What‚Äôs that? Never heard of her. Anyway, I approached Cami about this collab a few months ago (i think? Who knows, everything is a blur) and she very kindly agreed!  She even went ahead and made a video to go along with the cover! What‚Äôs it like to have that many talents, I must know. She kicked butt. She always kicks butt. A super big thanks to Miyo for kicking butt with this instrumental as well! As always, thank you all for your continued love and support!

This was a really fun art project to do, I highly recommend it if you are looking for creative activities to do. There is so much potential to do all kinds of different characters with these and create a completely original set. These are really awesome collectibles and make for such cool home decor. I could definitely see myself building a collection of them. They're also really fun to take apart and put back together lolI hope you guys enjoy watching me customize these dolls.

It was a little bit expensive with a price tag of $75, but I didn't even thought twice about buying it. I fell in love with it right away.The paint looked very bad, it also had some dents and some signs of its age. It was still working and had a new screw added, I guess someone quickly fixed it before selling. The plate did sit way too loose on the top part, that made me suspicious that it isn't the original one. After disassemling I thought this will be a very quick and easy restoration, but one thing came after the other and it tourned out to be the most challenging one i've done on this channel so far.I wanted to have a super glossy and perfect paint job. For that reason I applied three coats of high build primer after the regular primer and filler. Wet sanding with 400 and 800 grit made the base super smooth and perfectly even. Then it was time to apply two coats of light ivory. After it dried I masked it again and painted the brillant blue. The paint turned out absolutely amazing. The old glass cover was too messed up to even try to clean it. I milled a new one on the tiny cnc-milling machine. Instead of painting the back of it gold, I decided to mill a brass foil to put it underneath. I cut some threads into the housing and fixed the class with fake rivets in a brushed look.The whole mechanism of the scale needed much attention. I had to remake some parts that got destroyed during the disassembly. But the most difficult parts were definitely the aluminium part and the paper scale. This was my first attempt ever in metal spinning. After a few tries I knew how to do it and I was able to make an absolutely perfect part. The scale was warped due to the disassembly with water, so I had to make a new one from scratch. It required a lot of math to calculate all the diameters and angles, but it turned out very well.I spent a long time thinking about the plate. After my success with the metal spinning of the aluminium part I decided to try to make a new one out of a copper sheet. I made a negative form as a template out of wood and than spinn the copper sheet on it to a plate. After a failed tries, I suceed. The key point was to heat the sheet up before hand to make it soft. I then sanded it all clean and soldered a ring on the back.The plate, The scale with the aluminium part and the glass cover with the brass foil were definitely my personal highlights of this restoration. I think this is definitely one of the most favourite project I've done so far. It was very challenging and I had to learn many new skills to get the job done. After all I'm very happy with this restoration.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon and PayPal supporters and specially to:Yale BakerAdel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerDerek RussGregoryJustin PowerMellissa MarcusMuzaffer AksoyPaul MampillyVince ValentiAlan Hansonalex latzkoAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndreswara HermawanAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerChad BryantCristian ZorillaDamian RickardDan WilliamsDre GilleyHarper KimHunter R.JD SmithJessica AlexanderJonas RichartzJozette Sotojustin f.Kelly ImgrundLVEMarc CerisierMartin R√∏nnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPaul AmbryRisky DeemRobert EverichScott MarshallStuart MitchellSuirosThe CarlsonsTrevor KamÏõÖÎ°ù Ïú§Time and costs of this restoration:I was working on this project for 4 weeks$25 kitchen scale$20 2k primer$30 high build primer$30 2k coat light ivory$30 2k coat brillant blue$25 brass foil$5 transparent plastic$10 copper sheet$5 aluminium sheetMy camera:Panasonic HC-V180If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

Those protests have dominated news coverage. But when it comes to communicating the protests‚Äô scale, character, and purpose, a lot of that coverage falls short.Part of that is because of the media‚Äôs incentive to highlight the most dramatic imagery; it‚Äôs why so much protest coverage has been filled with violent and chaotic scenes of fire, looters, and tear gas. But it‚Äôs also because of the nature of protest imagery itself. In this video, journalism professor Jason Johnson and Vox editor Kainaz Amaria explain that, while the news can show you what a protest looks like, it‚Äôs a lot worse at telling you why it‚Äôs happening.Further reading: https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/5/29/21274891/george-floyd-cop-arrested-minneapolis-breonna-taylorVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I will start positive first and end with the negativity that I am addressing at this time. Friday morning, 6/5, Mary and I spoke to one another privately. She said in her most recent update video, that I had permission to share the conversation. I will not be doing this, but rather of giving an outlook on the situation and what has occurred since it began. Although us speaking to one another doesn't fix things on either ends, it does give me clarity that I now understand where she was coming from and feeling. Our conversation started off with frustration and anger on both parts, but ended with a bit of understanding and I am grateful for that. I did NOT expect this apology video to go trending, at first I couldn't understand why SO many people.. thousands.. were coming here to comment certain narratives that had nothing to do with the situation at hand. It all happened so fast, in the beginning, that for the first time in six years of this channel, I had to turn off the comments. Because of the words being said, some wishing me, BEGGING me to commit su!c!de, claiming they were going to have my kids removed, telling me to watch my back every moment of everyday until I quit, and so much more, much worse that I won't be posting here.. it was quite a lot at once. I had to remove myself from my husband and kids and get help immediately. I had to turn off comments for my safety and sanity. That did not stop people from going to my other social media, and the next morning when I planned on coming home, I hopped on Twitter to find Mary had created one. Her DMs were turned off, probably because of the new account, but I retweeted one of her tweets and she saw it, Dmd me, and we spoke. I stand by my apology to Mary and Mary only. Out of the 6,000 people I lost on our channel, what I have asked of the FAMILY members that left.. I ask if they ever wanted to come back, to check back up in six to twelve months to see if I have changed. If so, they can can choose at that time whether or not they would like to return. With that being said, here is my update, thank you, and statement regarding this for now.First off, to every ASMR creator who reached out to me.. making sure I was ok.. I can't even begin to thank you. People found my phone number from years ago. It would probably take days, if not weeks.. to go through the amount of love, suggestion, constructive criticism, help, and more that I have recieved. Even the family members who have left this channel, some have left very helpful future comments for me to reflect on, and learn from. The rest of this week I said Id be reflecting. I will continue to do so. I am back home with my family, I am filming videos for the future, and I am moving on since talking to Mary. After getting myself together to watch from the outside what was going on, one that Mary nor I could control.. I wanted to say this.Those of you who have begged me to end my life, to quit my channel, to have my kids removed.. I will do none of it and I will have none of it. As I said in my apology video - I am not a bad person. I have made mistakes and all I can do is learn from them. I can educate, involve myself, and do better. This channel is a safe space and I will be DAMNED if ANYONE comes over here making it a war zone. I did not think of that when I called out Mary. I stand by my initial reasoning to do so, but the words I used toward her and her alone I do NOT stand by. I, again, am sorry to Mary and what she went through that 24 hours. Those of you who said what you said to ME, trying to make me pay, and knock me down a peg or two, never going to happen. Ive worked too hard for six years to change my life and work on myself, work that will never be done and will come with mistakes and consequence at times, I will never end that. This channel will always remain a safe space and in time I will turn back on the comments and we can continue to use this as a place for EVERYONE, and we will move on from this. You will NEVER run me off the internet. You will never be a reason of why I suffer in life. This is what I love, what I do, what I will always do until YouTube itself shuts down. I will never leave.With that being said, everyone who's asked and has been messaging, tweeting, calling, texting, blowing me up and caring, I am alright, and I am so grateful for you. I am so grateful for my YouTube family, even those who chose to have left because they were disappointed. You were not a troll but one who was concerned, hurt, and I wish you well whether you choose to return or not. I am currently home safe with my family, yesterday our town came together for the very first time to protest for the black lives matter movement, and it was beautiful. Things are changing, I am changing. I will be back soon./end"
