Today I am going to be painting on and customizing a set of Russian nesting dolls (or matryoshka dolls). I have been waiting (and some of you too) forever to paint these, so I was really excited to finally decorate these and add my own style to them. It's a different type of doll customization haha. This was a really fun art project to do, I highly recommend it if you are looking for creative activities to do. There is so much potential to do all kinds of different characters with these and create a completely original set. These are really awesome collectibles and make for such cool home decor. I could definitely see myself building a collection of them. They're also really fun to take apart and put back together lolI hope you guys enjoy watching me customize these dolls.

Justice for George Floyd protests sparked after video surfaced showing George Floyd‚Äôs killing by a Minneapolis police officer.Protests erupted nationwide days after Floyd‚Äôs death calling for the arrests of all the officers involved after a Memorial Day viral video showed Floyd being pinned down by his neck by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Floyd, who is repeatedly heard in the video saying he can't breath and asking for Chauvin to get off his neck, died that day.The Minneapolis mayor on Tuesday fired all four officers involved in the incident. On Friday, Chauvin was arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. But the other three officers who were involved in the incident have not yet been arrested or charged, with prosecutors in Minnesota on Friday saying that charges are likely forthcoming.D.C. and Manassas are among cities across the nation who held protests Friday night demanding the remaining three officers involved in Floyd's death to be arrested and charged.For more on the protests and riots learn more here: https://bit.ly/2ZQhNQR"
